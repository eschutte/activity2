	<p> Hello there, my name is Evan Schutte, I am currently a senior in the Management Information Systems program at UNO.  Some of my favorite things to do in my free time include playing sports, watching my favorite TV shows, hanging out with my close friends and family, fishing, and as you can see snowboarding.  After I graduate this winter, I plan on taking multiple trips to Colorado to go snowboarding, and in March I will be going to Canada to snowboard in Whistler for my first time.

	<p> Above you will find a few links, one to my senior capstone project, and two others to some of my most visited web pages.  Here you will find many videos and articles on snowboarding and sports.  Also, you can follow me on twitter by clicking on the link below!
